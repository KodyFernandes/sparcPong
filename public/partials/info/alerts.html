	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>As great as sparc pong is, you should have other things to do during the day. Working seems 
		to be the most popular answer. Alerts are here to help you focus on your 
		daily work and only bring sparc pong into your focus when relevant. You can configure your 
		alert settings to get notifications for important events such as being challenged.</p>
		
	
	<h3>Setting up Alerts</h3>
	<p>Before any alerts will be sent, you must have an email address on file. This email address 
		can be a regular run of the mill email address, or the mail server for your wireless 
		company. Configuring your email address this way will allow you to receive text message 
		alerts on your mobile device. Log in and navigate to the "Account" tab to add an email. 
		For example, (843) 123-4567 on a verizon network would be 8431234567@vtext.com</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring Alerts</h3>
	<p>Now that you have an email address on file, you might not want to receive alerts for 
		everything. There is a solution to this too! Log in and navigate to the "Account" tab. 
		Here you can toggle alerts for the categories listed. The default is to recieve no 
		alerts at all.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Challenged</strong> - alerted when someone challenges you</li>
		<li><strong>Revoked</strong> - alerted when someone revokes a challange against you</li>
		<li><strong>Resolved</strong> - not yet enabled</li>
		<li><strong>Forfeited</strong> - alerted when someone forfeits your issued challenge</li>
	</ul>
